Tools for dumping/loading a SQLite database to diffable directory structure

## Installation

    pip install sqlite-diffable

## Demo

The repository at [simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup) contains a backup of the database on my blog, https://simonwillison.net/ - created using this tool.

## Dumping a database

Given a SQLite database called `fixtures.db` containing a table `facetable`, the following will dump out that table to the `dump/` directory:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ facetable
```
To dump out every table in that database, use `--all`:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ --all
```
To dump all table except some specific ones, use `--exclude` one or more times:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ --all \
  --exclude unwanted_first_table \
  --exclude unwanted_second_table
```
## Loading a database

To load a previously dumped database, run the following:
```bash
sqlite-diffable load restored.db dump/
```
This will show an error if any of the tables that are being restored already exist in the database file.

You can replace those tables (dropping them before restoring them) using the `--replace` option:
```bash
sqlite-diffable load restored.db dump/ --replace
```
## Converting to JSON objects

Table rows are stored in the `.ndjson` files as newline-delimited JSON arrays, like this:

```
["a", "a", "a-a", 63, null, 0.7364712141640124, "$null"]
["a", "b", "a-b", 51, null, 0.6020187290499803, "$null"]
```

Sometimes it can be more convenient to work with a list of JSON objects.

The `sqlite-diffable objects` command can read a `.ndjson` file and its accompanying `.metadata.json` file and output JSON objects to standard output:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson
```
The output of that command looks something like this:
```
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "a", "content": "a-a", "sortable": 63, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.7364712141640124, "text": "$null"}
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "b", "content": "a-b", "sortable": 51, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.6020187290499803, "text": "$null"}
```

Add `-o` to write that output to a file:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson -o output.txt
```
Add `--array` to output a JSON array of objects, as opposed to a newline-delimited file:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson --array
```
Output:
```
[
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "a", "content": "a-a", "sortable": 63, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.7364712141640124, "text": "$null"},
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "b", "content": "a-b", "sortable": 51, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.6020187290499803, "text": "$null"}
]
```

## Storage format

Each table is represented as two files. The first, `table_name.metadata.json`, contains metadata describing the structure of the table. For a table called `redirects_redirect` that file might look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "redirects_redirect",
    "columns": [
        "id",
        "domain",
        "path",
        "target",
        "created"
    ],
    "schema": "CREATE TABLE [redirects_redirect] (\n   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n   [domain] TEXT,\n   [path] TEXT,\n   [target] TEXT,\n   [created] TEXT\n)"
}
```

It is an object with three keys: `name` is the name of the table, `columns` is an array of column strings and `schema` is the SQL schema text used for tha table.

The second file, `table_name.ndjson`, contains newline-delimited JSON (aka [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/)) for every row in the table. Each row is represented as a JSON array with items corresponding to each of the columns defined in the metadata.

That file for the `redirects_redirect.ndjson` table might look like this:

```
[1, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-everything", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/", "2017-10-01T21:11:36.440537+00:00"]
[2, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-entries", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/entries/", "2017-10-01T21:12:32.478849+00:00"]
[3, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-links", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/links/", "2017-10-01T21:12:54.820729+00:00"]
```

## Reconstructing one table across versions

Rows are stored **by position**, so a dump keeps meaning even when a column is renamed, split, or when an old name is re-used for a different field. The `lineage` commands rebuild a single historical table from several versioned dump directories (one directory per version, passed oldest first):

```bash
sqlite-diffable lineage reconstruct archive/2021 archive/2022 archive/2023 \
  --changes changes.json -o unified.json
```

The changes file is a JSON list of *proven* schema changes. Only two types are accepted, each naming the version where it takes effect:

```json
[
  {"type": "rename", "effective_version": "2022", "from": "code", "to": "customer_no"},
  {"type": "split",  "effective_version": "2023", "from": "name",
   "into": ["first_name", "last_name"]}
]
```

`effective_version` may be a directory name (its label), a directory basename, or a full path. For a split, add `"sources": [2, 3]` to pin the destination columns by positional index instead of by name.

Identity rules, deliberately conservative:

- Columns are anchored to their **positional index** in each archive, never to their values. Cell contents are never used to guess ownership.
- Cross-version links come only from the supplied `rename`/`split` changes, plus unambiguous same-name continuation. There is no implicit merge, so an empty column with no evidence is never attached to another field.
- A name that is removed and later re-added (two different business fields both called `code`) stays **two separate fields**. Fields absent from a row's version are emitted as `null`, not inferred.

Each reconstructed row carries `_version` and `_source_directory` provenance (drop them with `--no-provenance`), and every unified field is always present so rows have identical column order.

### Tracing a reused column name

`lineage history` returns the full provenance of *every* field that ever used a name — one entry per distinct field, each tracing back to its original directory, positional column order, and the change notes that link its versions:

```bash
sqlite-diffable lineage history archive/2021 archive/2022 archive/2023 \
  --changes changes.json --name code
```

Use `lineage describe` for the full map: each version's physical columns, the unified field occupying each position (`effective_columns`), the validated changes, and every field with its positions and rename/split events.
