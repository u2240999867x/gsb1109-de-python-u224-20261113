Tools for dumping/loading a SQLite database to diffable directory structure

## Installation

    pip install sqlite-diffable

## Demo

The repository at [simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup](https://github.com/simonw/simonwillisonblog-backup) contains a backup of the database on my blog, https://simonwillison.net/ - created using this tool.

## Dumping a database

Given a SQLite database called `fixtures.db` containing a table `facetable`, the following will dump out that table to the `dump/` directory:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ facetable
```
To dump out every table in that database, use `--all`:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ --all
```
To dump all table except some specific ones, use `--exclude` one or more times:
```bash
sqlite-diffable dump fixtures.db dump/ --all \
  --exclude unwanted_first_table \
  --exclude unwanted_second_table
```
## Loading a database

To load a previously dumped database, run the following:
```bash
sqlite-diffable load restored.db dump/
```
This will show an error if any of the tables that are being restored already exist in the database file.

You can replace those tables (dropping them before restoring them) using the `--replace` option:
```bash
sqlite-diffable load restored.db dump/ --replace
```
## Converting to JSON objects

Table rows are stored in the `.ndjson` files as newline-delimited JSON arrays, like this:

```
["a", "a", "a-a", 63, null, 0.7364712141640124, "$null"]
["a", "b", "a-b", 51, null, 0.6020187290499803, "$null"]
```

Sometimes it can be more convenient to work with a list of JSON objects.

The `sqlite-diffable objects` command can read a `.ndjson` file and its accompanying `.metadata.json` file and output JSON objects to standard output:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson
```
The output of that command looks something like this:
```
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "a", "content": "a-a", "sortable": 63, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.7364712141640124, "text": "$null"}
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "b", "content": "a-b", "sortable": 51, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.6020187290499803, "text": "$null"}
```

Add `-o` to write that output to a file:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson -o output.txt
```
Add `--array` to output a JSON array of objects, as opposed to a newline-delimited file:
```bash
sqlite-diffable objects fixtures.db dump/sortable.ndjson --array
```
Output:
```
[
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "a", "content": "a-a", "sortable": 63, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.7364712141640124, "text": "$null"},
{"pk1": "a", "pk2": "b", "content": "a-b", "sortable": 51, "sortable_with_nulls": null, "sortable_with_nulls_2": 0.6020187290499803, "text": "$null"}
]
```

## Storage format

Each table is represented as two files. The first, `table_name.metadata.json`, contains metadata describing the structure of the table. For a table called `redirects_redirect` that file might look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "redirects_redirect",
    "columns": [
        "id",
        "domain",
        "path",
        "target",
        "created"
    ],
    "schema": "CREATE TABLE [redirects_redirect] (\n   [id] INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n   [domain] TEXT,\n   [path] TEXT,\n   [target] TEXT,\n   [created] TEXT\n)"
}
```

It is an object with three keys: `name` is the name of the table, `columns` is an array of column strings and `schema` is the SQL schema text used for tha table.

The second file, `table_name.ndjson`, contains newline-delimited JSON (aka [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/)) for every row in the table. Each row is represented as a JSON array with items corresponding to each of the columns defined in the metadata.

That file for the `redirects_redirect.ndjson` table might look like this:

```
[1, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-everything", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/everything/", "2017-10-01T21:11:36.440537+00:00"]
[2, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-entries", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/entries/", "2017-10-01T21:12:32.478849+00:00"]
[3, "feeds.simonwillison.net", "swn-links", "https://simonwillison.net/atom/links/", "2017-10-01T21:12:54.820729+00:00"]
```

## Checking two dumps for behavioural differences

Two dumps of the same schema can have very different `CREATE` statements while
behaving identically for the operations the business actually runs. `check`
compares the two definitions by replaying an allowed operation set in throwaway
databases, rather than by diffing SQL text.

```bash
sqlite-diffable check dump-a/ dump-b/ --operations operations.json --json
```

Both arguments accept a directory of `*.metadata.json` files (a dump
directory), a `.sql` file, a single `*.metadata.json` file, or inline SQL
prefixed with `sql:`. A JSON input may also be a list of objects, e.g. the
concatenated `metadata.json` content from two dumps. Statements are applied in
dependency order, so metadata files may be supplied in any filename order and
a table may be created after an index that references it.

Operations are supplied with `--operations` (a JSON array, a JSON
`{"operations": [...]}` object, or a file with one statement per line) or with
repeated `--operation` options. Each entry may be a plain SQL string or an
object:

```json
[
  "INSERT INTO entries (id, name, score) VALUES (1, 'Ada', 10)",
  {"sql": "INSERT INTO entries (id, name, score) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
   "params": [2, "Grace", 20]},
  {"steps": [
    "BEGIN",
    "UPDATE entries SET score = score + 1 WHERE id = 1",
    "COMMIT"
  ]}
]
```

An operation group (`steps`) stops at the first error and is judged as one
unit.

The result is one of:

- `different`: a shortest sequence of the allowed operations, up to
  `--max-length` (default 3), produces different results. The report shows the
  sequence and both outcomes.
- `equivalent`: both definitions were fully materialised and no sequence up to
  `--max-length` distinguished them. This is scoped to the supplied operations.
- `undecided`: no difference was found, but a statement could not be replayed
  and is listed under `unsupported` (with its reason), so no equivalence is
  claimed. A demonstrated difference is still reported as `different`.

Cosmetic changes (quote style such as `[name]` versus `"name"`, keyword case,
whitespace) are treated as equivalent. Changes to collations, unique or partial
index predicates, trigger `WHEN` clauses, checks and defaults are detected by
their effect on the replayed operations.

Exit status is `0` when no difference was found (`equivalent` or `undecided`) and
`1` when a distinguishing sequence exists.
